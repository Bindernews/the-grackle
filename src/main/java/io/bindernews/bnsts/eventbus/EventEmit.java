/**
 * <p>
 * Somewhat similar to NodeJS EventEmitter, each instance of {@link EventEmit} only has
 * one type of event, for simplicityâ€™s sake.
 * </p>
 * <br/>
 * <p>
 * Some event types are "read-only", but others may be mutable (e.g. events which can be cancelled).
 * To accommodate this, handlers may be added with a priority. Handlers are called from lowest to
 * highest priority (e.g. a handler with -5 priority will be called before a handler at 0, or 1).
 * <br/>
 * Handlers with the same priority will be called in effectively random order.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Recommended usage is to register handlers up-front once. Adding a large number of handlers,
 * or frequently adding and removing handlers, may degrade performance.
 * </p>
