# The Grackle

## Description
A flying ace who crash-landed near the Spire in an experimental craft.
She has a habit of catching both herself and others on fire.

## Mechanics
- Has ways to create and use Burn cards
- Has "Airborne" and "Grounded"/Normal stances
    - Airborne = Take 1/2 damage, Deal 1/2 damage (inverse of Wrath)
- Cards with "Airborne" may ONLY be played while Airborne
- Cards with "Grounded" may ONLY be played while NOT Airborne
- Phoenix Stance = player takes 1/2 damage, counts as Airborne and Grounded,
  at end of turn exit Phoenix Stance, gain 1 Cooling Phoenix, take another turn

## Buffs
- Fireheart - When you gain 10 Fireheart, gain HP, enter Phoenix Stance,

## Debuffs
- No-Fly Zone - Exit Airborne, cannot enter Airborne. Permanent.
- Cooling Phoenix - 1-turn cooldown after entering Phoenix Stance


## Relics
- Phoenix Charm: Upon death, removes 1/2 of your Max HP and heals you to full health.

## Phoenix Stance
Certain cards will grant *Fireheart*. Upon reaching 10 *Fireheart*
enter **Phoenix Stance**.

When entering **Phoenix Stance** heal 10% of your max HP. Phoenix Stance
counts as both **Airborne** and **Neutral**, and cannot be exited.
At the end of your turn, gain 1 **Phoenix Cooldown** and take another turn.
